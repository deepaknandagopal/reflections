How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Visually seeing it makes it easy to find the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Great to have it Since it makes to restore to any version i wanted too.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    gives advantage of when to commit
    not commiting inbetween the work


    Cons:
    Involes times

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To make the restore to that point of the file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    * Git log is used to show all the previous commits done till now with the commit description.
    * Git diff is used to compare the difference between two commits.
    * These two are used to find the history of the commits and the difference between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Becasue i can restore to any point even if it breaks something

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To make many versions so that i can learn how to use version control software
